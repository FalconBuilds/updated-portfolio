<h1>The Best Moves According to Jack</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>
  This comes in at number 1 as it is the combination of all the MCU movies so
  far, bringing a huge, exciting and climatic end to this phase of the MCU.
</p>
<h3>The Lego Movie</h3>
<p>
  This is just a fun film to watch whenever there is nothing on the TV. It is
  very nostalgic for any 90's kids who loved lego. Chris Pratt is great.
</p>
<h3>The Italian Job - 2003</h3>
<p>
  I think its a great reimagining of the original Italian job, Mark Wahlburg does
  a great job of leading a ruff and ready team into a revenge heist
